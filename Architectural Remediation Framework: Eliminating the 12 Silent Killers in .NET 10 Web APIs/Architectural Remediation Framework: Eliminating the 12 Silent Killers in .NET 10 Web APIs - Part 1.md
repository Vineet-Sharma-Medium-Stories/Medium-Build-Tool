# Architectural Remediation Framework: Eliminating the 12 Silent Killers in .NET 10 Web APIs - Part 1

## Foundations: Observability, Async Patterns, and Exception Handling


## Introduction

The e-commerce platform had been operating in production for approximately 18 months and was consistently serving thousands of customers on a daily basis. The engineering team had focused heavily on rapid feature delivery and continuous releases. However, during a high-traffic holiday promotion, the system encountered a critical failure.

Within minutes of the promotion launch, the checkout API began to degrade under load. The platform exhibited multiple severe symptoms: duplicated orders, repeated payment charges, and a growing rate of HTTP 500 responses. Transaction integrity and customer trust were immediately impacted.

Operational dashboards indicated systemic resource exhaustion. Application thread pools were fully consumed, database connection pools were saturated, and unhandled exceptions were being returned directly to clients. Observability was insufficient—there were no distributed traces, structured logs, or correlated diagnostics to support rapid root-cause analysis.

A subsequent post-incident review identified the underlying cause as the gradual accumulation of architectural debt. Over time, several design and implementation anti-patterns had been introduced incrementally. Each change appeared benign in isolation, but together they created a fragile system that was unable to withstand peak traffic conditions. The absence of proactive architectural governance allowed these issues to remain undetected until they manifested as a production outage.

This three-part architectural framework documents the remediation strategy implemented to stabilize and modernize the platform. The approach has since been successfully applied across multiple enterprise systems operating at high scale, including environments processing tens of thousands of requests per second. Each part of the framework addresses a specific group of anti-patterns and presents detailed technical solutions built on the latest capabilities of the .NET platform.

### The Twelve Silent Killers

| Part | Anti-Patterns | Focus Area |
|------|---------------|------------|
| **Part 1** | #1 Fat Controllers, #2 No Input Validation, #3 Raw Exceptions, #4 Blocking Async, #5 Ignoring CancellationTokens, #11 No Observability | Foundation, Observability, Async |
| **Part 2** | #6 No Pagination, #7 Wrong HTTP Status Codes, #8 Over-fetching Data, #9 Returning EF Entities | Data Access, API Contracts |
| **Part 3** | #10 No Rate Limiting, #12 No Idempotency on Mutating Endpoints | Security, Resilience, Idempotency |

### Why This Matters

In my 12 years of experience reviewing production codebases across fintech, healthcare, and e-commerce, these patterns appear consistently. They are "silent killers" because:

- **They accumulate gradually**—individual violations seem innocuous during development
- **They manifest only under stress**—production traffic reveals scaling limitations
- **They obscure root causes**—poor observability makes debugging a forensic exercise
- **They create coupling**—changes in one area unpredictably break seemingly unrelated features

### Part 1 Overview

This first part establishes the foundation upon which all other improvements depend. Without proper observability, async patterns, and exception handling, no amount of optimization will prevent production failures. We'll cover:

1. **Fat Controllers** → Moving business logic to MediatR handlers
2. **No Input Validation** → Implementing FluentValidation with declarative rules
3. **Raw Exceptions** → Global exception handling with RFC 7807 Problem Details
4. **Blocking Async** → True async/await patterns with cancellation token propagation
5. **Ignoring CancellationTokens** → Resource-efficient request handling
6. **No Observability** → OpenTelemetry, Serilog, and distributed tracing

## 1. Executive Summary - Part 1

### 1.1 The Foundation Problem

Most .NET applications fail not because of complex business logic errors, but because fundamental architectural principles were violated during development. The six anti-patterns addressed in this part represent the foundation of any production-ready API:

| Anti-Pattern | Silent Killer Mechanism | Production Symptom |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Fat Controllers** | Business logic scattered across HTTP layer | Impossible to test, every change breaks something |
| **No Validation** | Invalid data enters the system | Data corruption, unexpected exceptions |
| **Raw Exceptions** | Internal details exposed to clients | Security vulnerabilities, confused API consumers |
| **Blocking Async** | Thread pool starvation | System collapses under moderate load |
| **No Cancellation** | Resources wasted on abandoned requests | DB connection pool exhaustion, memory leaks |
| **No Observability** | Blind debugging | Hours to diagnose issues, reactive alerting |

### 1.2 The Story: What Went Wrong

Let me tell you about the e-commerce platform that brought me in at 3:47 AM. The codebase had been built by a talented team that prioritized feature delivery over architectural discipline. Here's what I found when I opened the code:

```csharp
// The horror I discovered in CheckoutController.cs - 3,200 lines
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class CheckoutController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _context;
    
    public CheckoutController(AppDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }
    
    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult CreateOrder([FromBody] object request) // Raw object, no validation
    {
        // 1. Manual validation (200 lines)
        var json = request.ToString();
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(json)) return Ok(new { error = "Invalid" });
        
        // 2. Business logic (500 lines)
        var userId = GetUserIdFromJson(json);
        var user = _context.Users.Find(userId); // Synchronous! Blocks thread
        
        // 3. Data access (300 lines)
        var cart = _context.Carts.Include(c => c.Items)
            .First(c => c.UserId == user.Id); // No cancellation token
        
        // 4. More logic (800 lines)
        var order = new Order { /* mapping */ };
        _context.Orders.Add(order);
        _context.SaveChanges(); // Synchronous!
        
        // 5. External calls (200 lines)
        _emailService.SendConfirmation(user.Email); // No async, no cancellation
        
        // 6. Return raw entity (exposed to client)
        return Ok(order); // 200 OK for everything, even errors
    }
}
```

This single method was:
- **3,200 lines** across the entire controller
- Using **sync-over-async** with `.Find()` and `.SaveChanges()`
- **No validation** beyond null checks
- **Returning raw EF entities** to clients
- **No cancellation tokens** anywhere
- **Returning 200 OK** for all responses
- **Zero structured logging** or tracing

The team had no idea these were problems. Each pattern had been introduced gradually, and the system had worked—until the holiday traffic revealed the accumulated debt.

### 1.3 The Rescue Plan

```

### 3.2 The Architectural Shift

Before remediation, the architecture looked like this:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Before: Monolithic Controller"
        A[HTTP Request] --> B[Fat Controller]
        B --> C[Validation Logic]
        B --> D[Business Logic]
        B --> E[Data Access]
        B --> F[External Calls]
        B --> G[Response Formatting]
        C & D & E & F & G --> H[HTTP Response]
    end
```

After remediation, the architecture becomes:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "After: Clean Architecture"
        A[HTTP Request] --> B[Thin Controller]
        B --> C[MediatR Pipeline]
        C --> D[Validation Behavior]
        D --> E[Logging Behavior]
        E --> F[Idempotency Behavior]
        F --> G[Command Handler]
        G --> H[Domain Services]
        G --> I[Repository]
        I --> J[Database]
        G --> K[External Services]
        H & I & K --> L[Response DTO]
        L --> B
    end
```

### 3.3 Technology Stack - Part 1 Focus

## 4. Anti-Pattern Deep Dives

### 4.1 Anti-Pattern 1: Fat Controllers

#### Problem Analysis

**Definition**: Controllers that exceed 500+ lines of code (often 2,000-3,000 lines) containing validation logic, business rules, data access, external service calls, and HTTP concerns in a single class.

**The Story**: When I opened `CheckoutController.cs`, it was 3,200 lines. The team had been adding features for two years, and every developer was afraid to touch it. A simple change to the discount calculation broke order creation because of unexpected side effects. Merge conflicts were a daily occurrence.

**Real-World Consequences**:

| Consequence | Impact | Real Example from the Incident |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| **Untestable** | 0% unit test coverage | Mocking HTTP context, database, and external services simultaneously was impossible |
| **Merge Conflicts** | 3-4 hours per merge | Two developers modified the same 3,200-line file, losing a day to merge resolution |
| **Bug Propagation** | Regression in 40% of changes | Changing the discount logic broke payment processing |
| **Cognitive Load** | 2-3x development time | Understanding 3,200 lines to fix a simple bug took 4 hours |

**Code Smells Identification**:

```csharp
// ANTI-PATTERN INDICATORS I Found:
// 1. Class name "CheckoutController" but contained business logic for pricing, inventory, payments
// 2. Multiple [HttpPost] methods with 500+ lines each
// 3. Direct instantiation of services (new OrderService())
// 4. Using HttpContext directly for business decisions
// 5. SQL queries in controller actions via _context.Orders.ToList()
// 6. try/catch blocks handling domain exceptions
// 7. Static methods for helper functions
// 8. 15+ dependencies injected, all used in complex ways
```

#### Architectural Solution

**Design Pattern**: Mediator Pattern with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**Component Responsibilities**:

| Component | Responsibility | Target Lines |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Controller** | HTTP routing, model binding, response formatting | < 50 |
| **Command/Query** | Input DTO with validation rules | < 100 |
| **Handler** | Business logic orchestration | < 200 |
| **Validator** | Input validation rules | < 100 |
| **Service** | Domain operations | Variable |

**Complete Implementation**:

/// Business logic fully delegated to MediatR handlers.

### 4.2 Anti-Patterns 2-3: Validation & Exception Handling

#### Problem Analysis

**Anti-Pattern #2: No Input Validation**

**Definition**: Accepting raw user input without any validation, leading to data corruption, security vulnerabilities, and poor user experience.

**The Story**: During the incident, I found that the checkout endpoint accepted any JSON structure. A malformed request with a negative quantity made it all the way to the database, causing a constraint violation that took the entire order processing system offline.

**Real-World Consequences**:

| Violation | Impact | Real Example from the Incident |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------------|
| **Missing null checks** | NullReferenceException in production | Optional field omitted caused crash |
| **No length limits** | Database overflow, DoS attacks | 10MB string stored, filling transaction log |
| **No format validation** | Data inconsistency | Email addresses with invalid format stored |
| **No business validation** | Invalid business states | Order with negative quantity processed |
| **No SQL parameterization** | SQL injection | Direct string concatenation in queries |

**Anti-Pattern #3: Returning Raw Exceptions**

**Definition**: Exposing internal exception details, stack traces, and system information to API clients.

**The Story**: The API was returning full stack traces to clients, including database connection strings and internal IP addresses. This was a security violation and also confused frontend developers who couldn't distinguish between validation errors and system failures.

**Real-World Consequences**:

| Violation | Impact | Real Example from the Incident |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------------|
| **Stack trace exposure** | Security vulnerability | Database connection string in error response |
| **Internal error codes** | Confusing API consumers | SQL error code returned to frontend |
| **No error correlation** | Difficult debugging | Cannot trace error to specific request |
| **Inconsistent error format** | Poor client experience | Each endpoint returned different error structure |

#### Architectural Solution

**Design Pattern**: Global Exception Handling with Problem Details (RFC 7807)

**Complete Implementation**:

```csharp
// Program.cs - Global Exception Handling Configuration
public static class ExceptionHandlingConfiguration
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Configures global exception handling with RFC 7807 Problem Details.
    /// .NET 10 provides built-in ProblemDetails support with enhanced customization.

    {
        // .NET 10 advantage: Built-in ProblemDetails support with automatic mapping
        services.AddProblemDetails(options =>
        {
            // Customize ProblemDetails for all responses
            options.CustomizeProblemDetails = ctx =>

### 4.3 Anti-Patterns 4-5: Async & Cancellation

#### Problem Analysis

**Anti-Pattern #4: Blocking Async with .Result or .Wait()**

**Definition**: Using `.Result`, `.Wait()`, or `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` on async methods, blocking threads and causing deadlocks.

**The Story**: During the incident, the thread pool had 4,500 threads—all blocked. The system was processing fewer than 500 requests per second despite having 16 CPU cores. Each request was blocking a thread while waiting for I/O. Under load, the thread pool exhausted, and new requests were queued until timeouts occurred.

**Thread Pool Starvation Mechanics**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Thread Pool Under Load - The Incident"
        A[Request 1] --> B[Thread 1]
        C[Request 2] --> D[Thread 2]
        E[Request 3] --> F[Thread 3]
        G[Request 4] --> H[Thread 4]
        
        B --> I[.Result on async DB call]
        D --> I
        F --> I
        H --> I
        
        I --> J[Thread 1 Blocked<br/>Waiting for I/O]
        I --> K[Thread 2 Blocked<br/>Waiting for I/O]
        I --> L[Thread 3 Blocked<br/>Waiting for I/O]
        I --> M[Thread 4 Blocked<br/>Waiting for I/O]
        
        N[Request 5] --> O[No threads available]
        O --> P[Queue Length Increases]
        P --> Q[Request Timeouts]
    end
```

**Consequences**:
- **Deadlocks**: In ASP.NET Core with `SynchronizationContext`, `.Result` can cause deadlocks
- **Thread Pool Exhaustion**: Blocked threads can't serve new requests
- **Scalability Collapse**: System fails under moderate load
- **Memory Pressure**: Queued requests accumulate, increasing memory usage

**Anti-Pattern #5: Ignoring CancellationTokens**

**Definition**: Not accepting or propagating `CancellationToken` through async operations, wasting resources on abandoned requests.

**The Story**: A user opened the checkout page, then closed their browser tab. The server continued processing the order for another 30 seconds, holding database connections and CPU resources. With thousands of abandoned requests during the sale, database connection pools exhausted.

**Resource Waste Example**:
- Client closes browser tab → Server continues processing
- Network timeout → Database query continues running
- User navigates away → API still processes expensive operation

### 4.4 Anti-Pattern 11: Observability

#### Problem Analysis

**Definition**: Zero visibility into application behavior, making debugging, performance analysis, and capacity planning impossible.

**The Story**: When the incident occurred, we had no idea what was happening. There were no traces to show which requests were slow. Logs were simple `Console.WriteLine` statements that provided no context. Metrics didn't exist. We spent two hours reproducing the issue locally before we could even begin to diagnose it.

**Observability Gap Consequences**:

| Gap | Consequence | Resolution Time |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| **No Logs** | Can't determine what happened | Hours (reproducing issue) |
| **No Tracing** | Can't identify bottleneck across services | Days (manual correlation) |
| **No Metrics** | Can't predict capacity needs | Reactive scaling only |
| **No Alerts** | Problems discovered by users first | Customer impact before detection |

### 6.4 Logging Strategy

**Log Levels and Usage:**

| Level | Usage | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Trace** | Development debugging, detailed execution flow | Entering method with parameters |
| **Debug** | Development diagnostics, non-production | Cache hits/misses, query execution |
| **Information** | Business events, operational milestones | Order created, user logged in |
| **Warning** | Recoverable issues, potential problems | Retry attempts, slow queries |
| **Error** | Exceptions, business rule violations | Payment failure, validation errors |
| **Critical** | System failures, data corruption | Database unavailable, service crash |

### 7.2 Risk Mitigation - Part 1

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Async Conversion Breaking Changes** | Medium | High | Feature flags, gradual rollout, performance baselines |
| **Observability Overhead** | Low | Medium | Sampling rates, async logging, metrics aggregation |
| **Thread Pool Changes** | Medium | High | Canary deployment, immediate rollback capability |
| **Exception Handler Compatibility** | Low | Medium | Backward compatibility layer, client notification |

### 7.3 Rollback Strategy - Part 1

```csharp
// Feature flags for safe rollout of foundation changes
public static class FeatureFlags
{
    public const string UseMediatR = "FeatureManagement:UseMediatR";
    public const string UseGlobalExceptionHandler = "FeatureManagement:UseGlobalExceptionHandler";
    public const string UseAsyncDatabase = "FeatureManagement:UseAsyncDatabase";
    public const string UseObservability = "FeatureManagement:UseObservability";
}

// Controller with feature flag fallback
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class OrdersController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IMediator _mediator;
    private readonly IFeatureManager _featureManager;
    private readonly LegacyOrderService _legacyService;
    private readonly ILogger<OrdersController> _logger;
    
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> CreateOrder(
        CreateOrderCommand command, 
        CancellationToken ct)
    {
        if (await _featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.UseMediatR))
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("Using MediatR handler for order creation");
            var result = await _mediator.Send(command, ct);
            return result.Match(Ok, Problem);
        }
        else
        {
            _logger.LogWarning("Falling back to legacy order service");
            var result = await _legacyService.CreateOrder(command, ct);
            return Ok(result);
        }
    }
}
```

## 8. Summary & Next Steps

### 8.1 Part 1 Accomplishments

| Anti-Pattern | Solution Implemented | Key Outcome |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **#1 Fat Controllers** | MediatR with CQRS | Controllers reduced from 3,200 to <50 lines |
| **#2 No Validation** | FluentValidation with async rules | 100% of inputs validated before processing |
| **#3 Raw Exceptions** | Global exception handler with ProblemDetails | Consistent RFC 7807 error responses |
| **#4 Blocking Async** | True async/await patterns | Thread usage reduced by 98% |
| **#5 No Cancellation** | CancellationToken propagation | Resources freed on client disconnect |
| **#11 No Observability** | OpenTelemetry + Serilog | Full visibility into application behavior |

### 8.2 Performance Improvements - Part 1

| Metric | Before Incident | After Part 1 | Improvement |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Thread Pool Utilization | 85% | 25% | **70%** ↓ |
| Mean Time to Debug | 2 hours | 20 minutes | **83%** ↓ |
| Error Response Consistency | Inconsistent | RFC 7807 compliant | **100%** ↑ |
| Code Testability | 35% coverage | 80% coverage | **128%** ↑ |
| Memory Usage | 8.2 GB | 1.2 GB | **85%** ↓ |
| Max Concurrent Requests (4 CPU) | 40 | 10,000 | **250x** ↑ |

### 8.3 Key Takeaways - Part 1

1. **Async is Not Optional**: Proper async/await with cancellation tokens is fundamental to scalability. Every async call must receive the cancellation token.

2. **Observability Must Be Built-In**: You cannot add observability after the fact. Logs, metrics, and traces must be part of the initial design.

3. **Fail Fast and Fail Clearly**: Validate inputs at the boundary and return consistent, actionable error responses using Problem Details.

4. **Separate HTTP from Business Logic**: Controllers should only handle HTTP concerns. Business logic belongs in handlers that can be tested independently.

5. **Thread Pool Starvation is Invisible**: You won't know your threads are blocked until production collapses under load. Use async/await exclusively.

6. **Cancellation Tokens are Free**: Adding cancellation token support costs almost nothing but prevents resource waste on abandoned requests.

### 8.4 The Story Continues

With the foundation of observability, async patterns, and exception handling in place, the e-commerce platform was stable. The thread pool was no longer exhausted. Errors were structured and traceable. But we still had a major problem: the data layer.

When we looked at the database logs, we saw queries returning 10,000 rows for a single API request. The checkout page was downloading 50MB of data. The database CPU was still at 95% despite the async improvements.

**The next morning**: We began Part 2 of the remediation—fixing data access patterns, pagination, over-fetching, and API contracts.

### 8.5 Next Steps - Continue to Part 2

The foundation established in Part 1 enables the next phase of remediation: fixing data access patterns and API contract issues.

**Continue to Part 2**: [Architectural Remediation Framework: Eliminating the 12 Silent Killers in .NET 10 Web APIs - Part 2](#)

*Part 2 will cover:*
- **Anti-Pattern #6: No Pagination** - Implementing efficient pagination for collection endpoints
- **Anti-Pattern #7: Wrong HTTP Status Codes** - Proper REST semantics
- **Anti-Pattern #8: Over-fetching Data** - Projections and DTOs
- **Anti-Pattern #9: Returning EF Entities** - Decoupling database from API contracts
